    <h2 class="fade-in">Early Life</h2>
    <p class="fade-in">
        Born Augusta Ada Byron on December 10, 1815, Ada was the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron 
        and mathematician Lady Anne Isabella Milbanke. From an early age, her mother encouraged her to 
        pursue mathematics and science, hoping it would counterbalance her father’s romantic tendencies.
    </p>

    <h2 class="fade-in">About Ada</h2>
    <p class="fade-in">
        Ada Lovelace (1815–1852) was an English mathematician and writer, best known for her 
        work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical 
        Engine. She is often considered the first computer programmer for recognizing the 
        machine’s potential beyond pure calculation.
    </p>

    <h2 class="fade-in">Major Contributions</h2>
    <p class="fade-in">
        In 1842–1843, Ada translated an Italian mathematician’s paper on the Analytical Engine 
        and added her own notes, which were three times longer than the original work. These 
        notes contained what is recognized as the first published algorithm intended to be 
        executed by a machine.
    </p>

    <h2 class="fade-in">Her Legacy</h2>
    <p class="fade-in">
        Ada’s vision extended far beyond her time. She imagined machines creating music, art, 
        and more — ideas that wouldn’t become reality until more than a century later. Today, 
        she stands as a symbol of curiosity, creativity, and the power of ideas. Every year, 
        Ada Lovelace Day is celebrated to honor women's achievements in STEM.

    <ul class="fade-in">
        <li>She was just 17 when she met Charles Babbage.</li>
        <li>Her work was forgotten for nearly 100 years before being rediscovered.</li>
        <li>Ada was fascinated by flight and once tried to design a flying machine.</li>
        <li>The computer language "Ada" is named in her honor.</li>
